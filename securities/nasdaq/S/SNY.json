However, the company's decision in late 2019 to pull back from the cardio-metabolic area will likely reduce the firm's footprint in this large therapeutic area. The company offers a diverse array of drugs with its highest revenue generator, Dupixent, representing just over 10% of total sales, but profits are shared with Regeneron. About 30% of total revenue comes from the United States and 25% from Europe. Emerging markets represent the majority of the remainder of revenue."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.sanofi.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Dietmar P.
