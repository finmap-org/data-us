We are developing verekitug, the only known antagonist currently in clinical development that targets the receptor for Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin (\"TSLP\"), a cytokine which is a clinically validated driver of inflammatory response positioned upstream of multiple signaling cascades that affect a variety of immune mediated diseases. Preclinical and clinical data to date demonstrate verekitug's highly potent inhibition of the TSLP receptor, which we believe will translate to a differentiated product profile, including improved clinical outcomes, substantially extended dosing intervals and the potential to treat a broad spectrum of patients."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"www.upstreambio.com/"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
