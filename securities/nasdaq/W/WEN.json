After divestitures of Tim Horton's (2006) and Arby's (2011), the firm manages just the burger banner, generating sales across a footprint that spans almost 7,000 total units in 30 countries. Wendy's generates revenue from the sale of hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, salads, and fries throughout its company-owned footprint, through franchise royalty and marketing fund payments remitted by its franchisees, which account for 94% of stores, and through franchise flipping and advisory fees."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.wendys.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Deepak Ajmani","title":"Chief Operations Officer-US"},{"name":"Kirk C.
