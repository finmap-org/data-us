Photolithography is the process in which a light source is used to expose circuit patterns from a photomask onto a semiconductor wafer. The latest technological advances in this segment allow chipmakers to continually increase the number of transistors on the same area of silicon, with lithography historically representing a meaningful portion of the cost of making cutting-edge chips. Chipmakers require next-generation EUV lithography tools from ASML to continue past the 5-nanometer process node."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.ferrovial.com//"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Dimitris Bountolos","title":"Chief Information & Innovation Officer"},{"name":"Ignacio del Pino","title":"Chief Investment Officer"},{"name":"Ignacio Madridejos Fern√°ndez","title":"Chief Executive Officer & Director"}]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
