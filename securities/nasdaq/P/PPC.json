The 2019 purchase of Tulip, the U.K.'s largest hog producer, marks the firm's entrance into the pork market, which represents about 10% of sales. Pilgrim's sells its protein to chain restaurants, food processors, and retail chains. Channel exposure is split evenly between retail and food service, with the majority of food-service revenue coming from quick-service restaurants. JBS owns 80% of Pilgrim's outstanding shares; it attempted to purchase the remaining 20% in late 2021, but the board rejected JBS's $26.50 offer as inadequate, and we concur."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.pilgrims.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"FÃ¡bio Sandri","title":"President & Global Chief Executive Officer"}]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
