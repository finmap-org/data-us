Our principal products are edible gels and their application in gel-based dosage forms. Our current product suite consists of multiple products that sit within five core verticals-for pets, sports, pharmaceutical (pharma), over-the-counter (OTC) and nutraceutical-all of which leverage our patent pending multiple-ingredient dosage forms, and that we expect to have a wide range of applications and consumers. We currently focus our efforts on out-licensing our technology to companies to develop and create new products they can manufacture and sell within their established and researched markets, while we continue to manufacture our existing products under license. Of our products already licensed, two clients have placed initial orders for nutraceutical products, and there have been four other products in the sports vertical ordered."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.gelteq.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
