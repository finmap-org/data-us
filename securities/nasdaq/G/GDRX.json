The company's primary focus is the U.S. prescription drug market, where GoodRx has developed a price comparison tool that it aggregates from over 200 billion daily pricing data points, directing consumers toward coupons negotiated between a pharmacy and intermediaries (pharmacy benefit managers ). GoodRx generates revenue by taking a small share of the fees paid by pharmacies to PBMs in exchange for routing consumers to these discount programs, and separately through a subscription-based model (GoodRx Gold), which offers discounted drugs to customers paying a monthly membership fee."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.goodrx.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Scott W.
