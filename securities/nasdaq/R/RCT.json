We believe the Platform solves a decades old problem of how to unlock and enable access of key purchase and sales data between brands, distributors and retailers in high growth consumer markets. Through the Platform, we enable retailers in these markets to use data driven insights backed by artificial intelligence to help make faster and easier business-to-business purchases and inventory decisions from brands and distributors by breaking down complex purchasing behaviors of large product inventory catalogues. We then turn that into meaningful business insights and purchasing opportunities for our retailers. Our Platform is delivered through a consumption-based business model and we only charge brands and distributors for transactions made on the Platform."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.redcloudtechnology.com"}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
