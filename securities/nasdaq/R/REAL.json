The firm generates revenue via consignment and first-party sales on its online marketplace, and through direct sales across its brick-and-mortar footprint. With a hands-on approach that actively sources inventory and authenticates every item on its platform, The RealReal is able to justify much higher take rates than peers, working out to roughly 25% of gross merchandise value (or 35% of net merchandise value, which excludes returns, cancellations, and first-party sales)."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.therealreal.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Luke Thomas Friang","title":"Chief Technology & Product Officer"},{"name":"Rati Sahi Levesque","title":"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director"}]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
