The firm's culture emphasizes acquiring asset-light, cash-generative businesses. Roper then reinvests this excess cash in businesses that yield incrementally higher rates of return. While the businesses are managed in a decentralized manner, Roper does not passively manage its portfolio. Instead, Roper manages its businesses through the Socratic method and empowers decision-makers through group executive coaching. Roper has now rotated a clear majority of its business from legacy industrial products into technology software in mature, niche markets with large quantities of deferred revenue."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.ropertech.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Laurence Neil Hunn","title":"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director"}]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
