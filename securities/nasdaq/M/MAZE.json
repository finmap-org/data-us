We are advancing a pipeline using our Compass platform, which allows us to identify and characterize genetic variants in disease and then link those variants to the biological pathways that drive disease in specific patient groups through a process we refer to as variant functionalization. Our Compass platform has been purpose-built to inform all phases of our drug discovery and development process through clinical trial design. We are currently advancing two wholly owned lead programs, MZE829 and MZE782, each of which represents a novel precision medicine-based approach for chronic kidney disease. We initiated a Phase 2 trial of our lead drug candidate, MZE829, in November 2024."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.mazetx.com"}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
