Our PEPs are selectively engineered to have optimized pharmaceutical properties, including extended time-action profiles and consistent drug concentrations with low peak-to-trough concentration ratios, consistent exposure to target tissues, and less frequent dosing. We are advancing a pipeline of novel candidates for endocrine and metabolic disorders. Our lead product candidate, MBX 2109, is a parathyroid hormone peptide prodrug that is designed as a potential long-acting hormone replacement therapy for the treatment of chronic hypoparathyroidism, or HP. We designed MBX 2109 to treat the underlying pathophysiology of HP by providing a continuous, infusion-like exposure to parathyroid hormone, or PTH, with convenient once-weekly administration."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://mbxbio.com/"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
