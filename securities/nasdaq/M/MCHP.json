More than half of revenue comes from MCUs, which are used in a wide array of electronic devices from remote controls to garage door openers to power windows in autos. The company's strength lies in lower-end 8-bit MCUs that are suitable for a wider range of less technologically advanced devices, but the firm has expanded its presence in higher-end MCUs and analog chips as well."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.microchip.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Richard J.
