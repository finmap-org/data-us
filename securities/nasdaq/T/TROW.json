Rowe Price provides asset-management services for individual and institutional investors. It offers a broad range of no-load U.S. and international stock, hybrid, bond, and money market funds. At the end of April 2022, the firm had $1.420 trillion in managed assets, composed of equity (55%), balanced (30%), fixed-income (12%), and alternatives (3%) offerings. Approximately two thirds of the company's managed assets are held in retirement-based accounts, which provides T. Rowe Price with a somewhat stickier client base than most of its peers. The firm also manages private accounts, provides retirement planning advice, and offers discount brokerage and trust services. The company is primarily a U.S.-based asset manager, deriving just under 10% of its AUM from overseas."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.troweprice.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Andrew Justin MacKenzie Thomson","title":"Co-Chief Investment Officer"},{"name":"Eric Lanoue Veiel","title":"Co-Chief Investment Officer & Head-Global Equity"},{"name":"Kimberly H.
