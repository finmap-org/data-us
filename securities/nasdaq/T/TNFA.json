(Nasdaq: TNFA), is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company committed to extending healthy lifespan. We are focused on developing two novel therapeutic platforms that treat the causes of disease rather than only addressing the symptoms. MYMD-1 is a drug platform based on a clinical stage small molecule that regulates the immune system to control TNF-alpha, which drives chronic inflammation, and other pro-inflammatory cell signaling cytokines. MYMD-1 is being developed to treat diseases and disorders marked by acute or chronic inflammation. Our second drug platform, Supera-CBD, is being developed to treat chronic pain, addiction and epilepsy. Supera-CBD is a novel synthetic derivative of cannabidiol (CBD) and is being developed to address and improve upon the rapidly growing CBD market, which includes both FDA approved drugs and CBD products not currently regulated as drugs."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://tnfpharma.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Mitchell Glass","title":"President, Director & Chief Medical Officer"}]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
