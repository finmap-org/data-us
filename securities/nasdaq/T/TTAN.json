We are modernizing a massive and technologically underserved industry-an industry commonly referred to as the \"trades.\" The trades consist of the collection of field service activities required to install, maintain, and service the infrastructure and systems of residences and commercial buildings. Tradespeople-like your local plumber, roofer, landscaper, HVAC technician and others who are employed in the trades-are immensely skilled and extensively trained. They are the essential, unsung heroes who work tirelessly to ensure that our needs are met where we live or work, ready at a moment's notice to leave their families in the middle of the night to go across town to help others. The trades constitute a large, expanding cornerstone of our economy. There are hundreds of thousands of trades businesses providing essential services in every corner of the country."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.servicetitan.com/"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
