CRAC channels serve to replenish calcium levels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and provide calcium for cellular signaling events. Its lead product candidate, Auxora, is an intravenous-formulated, small molecule CRAC channel inhibitor. Auxora has the capability to modulate the immune response and protect against tissue cell injury, addressing inflammatory diseases, such as acute pancreatitis (AP), asparaginase-associated acute pancreatitis (AAP), acute kidney injury (AKI), and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.graybug.vision"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Andrew Cunningham","title":"Senior Vice President-Clinical Development"},{"name":"Kenneth A.
