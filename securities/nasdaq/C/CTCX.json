The Carmell SecretomeTM consists of a potent cocktail of growth factors and proteins extracted from allogeneic human platelets sourced from U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved tissue banks. Over the past seven years, Carmell has extensively tested the technology underpinning the Carmell SecretomeTM. In addition, Carmell has developed a novel microemulsion formulation that enables the delivery of lipophilic and hydrophilic ingredients without relying on the Foul FourteenTM, which are 14 potentially harmful excipients that are commonly used by other companies to impart texture, stability, and other desirable physicochemical attributes to cosmetic products. Additionally, Carmell's microemulsion formulations do not utilize mineral or vegetable oils across its entire product line and are designed to be non-comedogenic."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.carmellcorp.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Kendra Bracken-Ferguson","title":"Chief Executive Officer"}]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
