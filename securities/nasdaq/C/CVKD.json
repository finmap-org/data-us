Tecarfarin is expected to reduce adverse events such as strokes, heart attacks, and bleeds compared to warfarin, which poses challenges due to drug interactions, kidney impairment and frequent dosing adjustments. Cadrenal is focused on evaluating tecarfarin's superiority to warfarin in patients for whom direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are not recommended in the treatment guidelines of leading cardiology associations. Tecarfarin has orphan drug and fast-track designations for LVAD and end-stage kidney disease patients with atrial fibrillation. Cadrenal is advancing a pivotal trial and pursuing clinical and commercial partnerships, with plans to study mechanical heart valve patients facing anticoagulation challenges."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.cadrenal.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Douglas W.
