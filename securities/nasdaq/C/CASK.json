We sell our products through wholesale distribution, directly to consumers through our five owned and operated distilleries and tasting rooms located in Washington and Oregon and by shipping directly to consumers on-line where legal. Currently, we sell products primarily in the Pacific Northwest with limited distribution in other states throughout the U.S. In addition, in collaboration with Native American tribes, we have recently developed a new sales, manufacturing and distribution channel on tribal lands that we expect will increase and broaden the recognition of our brand as that network expands nationally."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://heritagedistilling.com/"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
