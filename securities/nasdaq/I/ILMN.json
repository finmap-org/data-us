The company generates over 90% of its revenue from sequencing instruments, consumables, and services. Illumina's high-throughput technology enables whole genome sequencing in humans and other large organisms. Its lower throughput tools enable applications that require smaller data outputs, such as viral and cancer tumor screening. Illumina also sells microarrays (less than 10% of sales) that enable lower-cost, focused genetic screening with primarily consumer and agricultural applications."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.illumina.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Carissa Rollins","title":"Chief Information Officer"},{"name":"Jacob Thaysen","title":"Chief Executive Officer & Director"},{"name":"Kevin Pegels","title":"Chief-Global Operations"},{"name":"Steven Barnard","title":"Chief Technology Officer"}]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
