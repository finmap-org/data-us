Since then, Invisalign has become a household name, having treated over 10 million patients with malocclusion (misaligned teeth) through orthodontist and dentist-guided treatment plans. The company maintains dominant market share of clear aligners, despite the introduction of direct-to-consumer competitors upon the expiration of key patents that began in 2017. Align also manufactures intraoral scanners (iTero), used for orthodontic treatment and restorative dental procedures (digital models for crowns, veneers, and implants)."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.aligntech.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Joseph M.
