We have focused our efforts on developing selective compounds, targeting Bitter Taste Receptors (TAS2Rs) for hunger-associated conditions. Our wholly-owned lead product candidate, ARD-101 (denatonium acetate monohydrate), is an oral gut-restricted small-molecule agonist of certain TAS2Rs expressed in the gut lumen for which we have initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial for hyperphagia associated with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). We also intend to evaluate ARD-101 in a Phase 2 clinical trial for hyperphagia associated with acquired hypothalamic obesity resultant from treatment of craniopharyngioma, including surgery or radiation (HO)."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.aardvarktherapeutics.com"}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
