We are developing elraglusib (formerly 9-ING-41), a small molecule that is designed to enter cancer cells and block the function of the enzyme GSK-3B. We believe that the blockade of GSK-3B signaling ultimately results in the death of the cancer cells and the regulation of anti-tumor immunity. We have exclusively licensed a portfolio of GSK-3 inhibitors developed in a collaboration between the University of Illinois-Chicago (UIC) and Northwestern University (NU)."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"actuatetherapeutics.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Andrew P.
