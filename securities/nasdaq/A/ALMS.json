We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with an initial focus on developing our two Tyrosine Kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitors: ESK-001, a second-generation inhibitor that we are developing to maximize target inhibition and optimize tolerability, and A-005, a central nervous system (CNS) penetrant molecule. ESK-001 has demonstrated significant therapeutic effect in our Phase 2 program in patients with PsO, which we define as moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, and is currently being evaluated in additional Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and non-infectious uveitis, for which we expect to report results in 2026 and by the end of 2024, respectively."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":null},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"David M.
