Our lead program ficerafusp alfa is a bifunctional antibody that combines two clinically validated targets, an epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, directed monoclonal antibody with a domain that binds to human transforming growth factor beta, or TGF-b. Ficerafusp alfa is initially being developed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, or HNSCC, where there remains a significant unmet need. We intend to initiate a pivotal Phase 2/3 trial of ficerafusp alfa in combination with pembrolizumab as a first-line therapy in recurrent/metastatic HNSCC excluding HPV-positive patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma late in the fourth quarter of 2024 or early in the first quarter of 2025."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.bicara.com/"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
