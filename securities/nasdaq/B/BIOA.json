Our technology platform and differentiated human datasets enable us to identify promising targets based on insights into molecular changes that drive aging. Azelaprag, our lead product candidate, demonstrated the ability to more than double the weight loss induced by a glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist while also restoring healthy body composition and improving muscle function in preclinical obesity models. These preclinical results are supported by our Phase 1b clinical trial in older adults on bed rest where we observed decreased muscle atrophy, preservation of muscle quality and improved metabolism in subjects treated with azelaprag over a 10-day period."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://bioagelabs.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
