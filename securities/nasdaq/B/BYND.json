Unlike other vegetarian products, Beyond Meat seeks to replicate the look, cook, and taste of meat, is targeted to omnivores and vegetarians alike, and is sold in the meat case. The products are widely available across the U.S. and Canada and in 83 additional countries as well. International revenue represented 31% of 2021 sales. The firm's products are available in retail stores and the food-service channel. In 2019, before the pandemic struck, sales were evenly split between these two channels, although mix stood at 70% retail/30% food service in 2021. We think the recovery from the crisis and new deals with McDonald's and Yum Brands will return food-service sales to 50% in time."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.beyondmeat.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Ethan Walden Brown","title":"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director"},{"name":"Jonathan Nelson","title":"Senior Vice President-Operations"}]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
