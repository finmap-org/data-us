The latter had to divest these rights due to antitrust mandates as it consummated its 2013 acquisition of dominant Mexican brewer, Grupo Modelo. Constellation's wine/spirits business has recently transitioned, divesting several lower-margin assets, including myriad wine brands and its Ballast Point craft beer brand. The firm imports most products after manufacturing them abroad, going to market through independent wholesalers. It owns 36% of Canopy Growth, a leading provider of medicinal and recreational cannabis products."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.cbrands.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Ash Mehra","title":"Chief Data & Information Officer"},{"name":"William A.
