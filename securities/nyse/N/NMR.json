It is also the largest asset-management company in Japan, with a similar size differential compared with its rivals. Despite its topnotch brand name in retail broking and asset management in Japan, Nomura has struggled to compete effectively in the institutional securities business against larger global rivals. In 2008, Nomura bought European and Asian assets of the failed Lehman Brothers, which led to a sharply higher cost base but did not provide commensurate revenue. Nomura has reduced the scale of these businesses but maintains its ambition to compete globally with the top players."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.nomuraholdings.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Jun Yoshimura","title":"Executive Officer & Head-Group IT"},{"name":"Kentaro Okuda","title":"President, Group CEO & Representative Director"}]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
