Fastly's strategy differs from traditional CDNs, which focused on locating servers in as many locations as possible to store copies of files that consumers most use. Fastly has far fewer sites than traditional CDNs, but it houses servers in the most network-dense data centers. Instead of simply storing static content, it allows its customers to program on its platform, enabling edge computing and better service of the more dynamic content that was traditionally not well served by CDNs. Fastly gears its service to the largest, most sophisticated enterprises rather than small companies and generated about two thirds of its revenue in the United States in 2020."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.fastly.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Artur Bergman","title":"Director & Chief Technology Officer"},{"name":"Marshall Erwin","title":"Chief Information Security Officer"},{"name":"Nick Rockwell","title":"Executive Vice President-Strategy & Operations"},{"name":"Todd Nightingale","title":"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director"},{"name":"Tyler McMullen","title":"Chief Technology Officer"}]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
