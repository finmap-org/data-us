TSMC was founded in 1987 as a joint venture of Philips, the government of Taiwan, and private investors. It went public as an ADR in the U.S. in 1997. TSMC's scale and high-quality technology allow the firm to generate solid operating margins, even in the highly competitive foundry business. Furthermore, the shift to the fabless business model has created tailwinds for TSMC. The foundry leader has an illustrious customer base, including Apple and Nvidia, that looks to apply cutting-edge process technologies to its semiconductor designs."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.tsmc.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Che Chia Wei","title":"Chairman & Chief Executive Officer"},{"name":"Chris Horng-Dar Lin","title":"Chief Information Officer"},{"name":"J.
