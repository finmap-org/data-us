The firm operates over 3,100 facilities worldwide, mostly in the U.S., and treats over 240,000 patients globally each year. Government payers dominate U.S. dialysis reimbursement. DaVita receives approximately 69% of U.S. sales at government ( primarily Medicare) reimbursement rates, with the remaining 31% coming from commercial insurers.
