It has more than 35 million rentable square feet across five continents. Digital offerings range from retail co-location where an enterprise may rent a single cabinet and rely on Digital to provide all the accommodations to cold shells where hyperscale cloud service providers can simply rent much or all of a barren power-connected building. In recent years Digital Realty has de-emphasized cold shells and now primarily provides higher-level service to tenants which outsource their related IT needs to Digital. Digital Realty has also moved more into the co-location business increasingly serving enterprises and facilitating network connections. Digital Realty operates as a real estate investment trust."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.digitalrealty.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Andrew P.
