The company's product offerings fall under traditional OTC drug categories (i.e. cough, cold, allergy, pain), in addition to oral care, infant nutrition (formula), and nicotine cessation aids. In addition to private label manufacturing, the company also sells products under its own brands (largely in the skincare and oral-care category). The company became a pure-play in OTC consumer healthcare in 2021, following a series of divestitures over several years (sold off generic prescription topicals, animal health, and active pharmaceutical ingredient business). In late 2021, Perrigo signed an offer to acquire HRA Pharma."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.perrigo.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Alison Ives","title":"Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP"},{"name":"Patrick Lockwood-Taylor","title":"President, Chief Executive Officer & Director"},{"name":"Ronald C.
