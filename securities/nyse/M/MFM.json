Its investment objective is to seek high current income exempt from federal income tax but may also consider capital appreciation. Fund Investments in debt instruments may decline in value as the result of, or perception of, declines in the credit quality of the issuer, borrower, counterparty, or other entity responsible for payment, underlying collateral, or changes in economic, political, issuer-specific, or other conditions. Certain types of debt instruments can be more sensitive to these factors and therefore more volatile. In addition, debt instruments entail interest rate risk (as interest rates rise, prices usually fall). Therefore, the portfolio's value may decline during rising rates. Portfolios that consist of debt instruments with longer durations are generally more sensitive to a rise in interest rates than those with shorter durations."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.mfs.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
