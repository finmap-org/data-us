The Trust will invest at least 80% of its Managed Assets in municipal securities. The Trust will invest primarily in investment grade quality securities, which are securities rated within the four highest grades or securities that are unrated but judged to be of comparable quality by the Advisor. Municipal securities rated Baa by Moodys are investment grade, but Moodys considers municipal securities rated Baa to have speculative characteristics. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity for issuers of municipal securities that are rated BBB or Baa (or that have equivalent ratings) to make principal and interest payments than is the case for issuers of higher grade municipal securities."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":null},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"John M.
