Product mix is fairly diverse, with 51% of the firm's managed assets in equity strategies, 29% in fixed income, 8% in multi-asset class, 9% in money market funds, and 3% in alternatives. Passive strategies account for around two thirds of long-term AUM, with the company's iShares ETF platform maintaining a leading market share domestically and on a global basis. Product distribution is weighted more toward institutional clients, which by our calculations account for around 80% of AUM. BlackRock is also geographically diverse, with clients in more than 100 countries and more than one third of managed assets coming from investors domiciled outside the U.S. and Canada."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.blackrock.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
