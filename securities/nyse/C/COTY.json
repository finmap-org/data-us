Coty's most popular color cosmetic brands are CoverGirl, Max Factor, Rimmel, Sally Hansen, and Kylie. Coty also holds a minority stake in a salon and retail haircare business, including brands Wella, Clairol, OPI, and GHD. Francois Coty founded the firm in 1904 and it remained private until its 2013 IPO. It had focused on prestige fragrances and nail salon brands until the 2016 acquisition of Procter & Gamble's beauty business. This nearly doubled the firm's revenue base, and launched it into mass-channel cosmetics and professional hair care."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.coty.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Shi mei Fan","title":"Chief Scientific Officer"},{"name":"Sue Y.
