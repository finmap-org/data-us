When operating at normal production, the flagship McArthur River mine in Saskatchewan accounts for roughly 50% of output in normal market conditions. Amid years of uranium price weakness, the company has reduced production, instead purchasing from the spot market to meet contracted deliveries. In the long term, Cameco has the ability increase annual uranium production by restarting shut mines and investing in new ones. In addition to its large uranium mining business, Cameco operates uranium conversion and fabrication facilities."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.cameco.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Brian Reilly","title":"Chief Operating Officer & Senior Vice President"},{"name":"C.
