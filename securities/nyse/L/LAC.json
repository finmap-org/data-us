We expect the Nevada project, Thacker Pass, to enter production in the middle of the 2020s and the second brine resource, Pastos Grandes, to enter production in the late-2020s. Lithium Americas plans for all three resources to be fully integrated, selling into the lithium chemical market. The company is also exploring separating into two companies, with assets divided by geography, an Argentina company and a U.S. company."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.lithiumamericas.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Jonathan D.
