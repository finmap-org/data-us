We emphasize high-touch, individualized clinical, drug dispensing and administration capabilities that are tailored to serve the needs of residents in historically lower acuity LTCFs, such as assisted living facilities (ALFs), and behavioral health facilities and group homes (collectively BHFs). More than two-thirds of our annual revenue for each of the past three years has been generated from residents of ALFs and BHFs, which are our target markets, while the remainder has been generated primarily from residents of skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). Additionally, our robust capabilities enable us to serve residents in all types of LTCFs."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":null},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
