OS Therapies was launched to meet significant unmet need for new treatments in cancers of the bone in kids and adults. Osteosarcoma is an extremely challenging and often aggressive cancer that has particular treatment challenges due to location, changing genotypes, and high recurrence rates. At OST, we are trying to answer the calls for new treatments, considering there have been no new treatments for OS in over 30 years. OST has expanded the pipeline beyond Osteosarcoma with OST-HER2 into other solid tumors with the same recurrence mechanism of action, including Breast, Esophageal and Lung cancer. With the addition of OST-tADC, considered a next generation Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC) platform technology, we will be targeting Ovarian, Lung and Pancreatic cancer."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":null},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Paul A.
