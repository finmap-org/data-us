We are focused on becoming a first-person view (FPV) drone technology market leader. Current acquisition targets include Fat Shark which is the leader in FPV, designing and manufacturing ultra-low latency video goggles for drone pilots, as well as Rotor Riot which is a rapidly growing ecommerce marketplace, backed by the largest community of FPV drone pilots in the world. Over the next two years, these businesses are expected to continue to excel in the FPV market, while expanding into new enterprise verticals like public safety and drone delivery. Assuming we can close the acquisition, this is part of our vision to enable people to be part of the robotics revolution."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":null},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Allan Evans","title":"Chairman & Chief Executive Officer"},{"name":"Andrew Camden","title":"Chief Operating Officer"}]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
