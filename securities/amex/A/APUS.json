Apimeds is currently developing Apitox as a potential osteoarthritis treatment for patients with knee pain who failed to respond adequately to conservative non-pharmacologic therapy and simple analgesics. Apitoxin has been used in the South Korea to treat the reduction of pain associated with OA since 2003 and now we will be pursuing a second Phase III trial to meet agreed upon FDA standards. Upon the successful completion of our Phase III trial demonstrating therapeutic effect and extended safety data for the use of Apitox to treat pain and mobility in patients with knee OA, we intend to submit a Biologics License Application for Apitox."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":null}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
