The Company is focused on developing ABP-450 (prabotulinumtoxinA) injection for the treatment of debilitating medical conditions with an initial focus on the neurology and gastroenterology markets. ABP-450 contains a 900 kDa botulinum toxin type-A complex produced by the bacterium clostridium botulinum. The active part of the botulinum toxin is the 150 kDa component, and the remaining 750 kDa of the complex is made up of accessory proteins. When injected at therapeutic levels, ABP-450 blocks peripheral acetylcholine release at presynaptic cholinergic nerve terminals by cleaving SNAP-25, a protein integral to the docking and release of acetylcholine from vesicles situated within the nerve endings leading to denervation and relaxation of the muscle. It is also engaged in the Phase II clinical study of ABP-450 for the treatment of cervical dystonia. Cervical dystonia, also known as spasmodic torticollis, is a neurological condition."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.aeonbiopharma.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Chad K.
