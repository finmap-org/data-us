These therapeutics include antibodies and small molecules for the treatment of prostate cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer and glioblastoma. We are driven by innovative science to develop novel and transformative drug therapies to treat cancer. In June 2021, Kairos acquired Enviro Therapeutics through a share exchange. The acquisition allowed us to incorporate into our company Enviros advanced pipeline of drug candidates in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. The pipeline includes two therapeutic agents addressing what we believe to be significant unmet needs in the prostate and lung cancer markets and that we believe can help address cancer progression in those cancers that develop resistance to standard therapies."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":null},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
